# DOCKER PROJECT
Docker is basically a container engine which uses the Linux Kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system and automates application deployment on the container. Docker uses Copy-on-write union file system for its backend storage.
ABOUT PROJECT :

I build a project where any body can launch Joomla with MariaDB database.For this i create a .yml file using docker-compose by which any body can run this file in their machine and launch Joomla using just a single command.This make very easy to use Joomla.I know this is simple project but this taught me alot.

Joomla is a content management system (CMS), which enables you to build web sites and powerful online applications.Joomla has thousands of free extensions and templates allowing you to customize your site to fit your specific needs.every website or application use database so i used MariaDB as my database server.MariaDB Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases.
